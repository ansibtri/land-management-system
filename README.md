# üåê Web-Based Land Management System Using MERN Stack

## üìò Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Land Management System** designed to address inefficiencies and lack of transparency in land-related administrative processes in **Nepal**. Utilizing the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), the system digitizes critical workflows such as **land registration, property transactions, and land tax clearance**.

The platform provides a centralized, user-friendly **Management Information System (MIS)** that replaces traditional paper-based and manual procedures. It is aimed at improving public service delivery in land administration through automation, data integrity, and enhanced accessibility.

## üéØ Objectives

- To **digitize** land registration and ownership record-keeping.
- To **simplify and speed up** property buying and selling processes.
- To enable **secure and verifiable land tax clearance** via integrated bank voucher submissions.
- To establish a **transparent and traceable** record system for both users and government administrators.
- To minimize delays and corruption associated with traditional land management workflows.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack (MERN)

- **MongoDB:** Stores user data, land records, transaction history, tax details.
- **Express.js:** Backend framework managing REST APIs for CRUD operations and authentication.
- **React.js:** Frontend UI for interactive user experience, dashboards, and form submissions.
- **Node.js:** Server-side runtime environment handling logic, routing, and integration with external services (e.g., bank APIs or voucher systems).

## üîê Key Features

1. **Digital Land Registration**
   - Register land ownership records online.
   - Admin verification and approval flow.
   - Attach supporting documents and KML/GeoJSON-based map integration (optional in advanced version).

2. **Property Transactions**
   - Buy/sell requests with digital consent flow.
   - Transaction history and legal verification.
   - Smart alerts and status tracking.

3. **Land Tax Clearance**
   - Submit land tax payment proofs through bank voucher uploads.
   - Tax calculation module based on land area and property type.
   - Payment tracking with admin verification and clearance generation.

4. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Citizen, Admin, Municipality Officer, Tax Officer roles with limited permissions.
   - Admin dashboard for analytics, approvals, and logs.

5. **Search & Visualization**
   - Search land plots, owners, tax status using plot number or citizen ID.
   - Display land data visually using interactive map tools (future integration).

## ‚úÖ Benefits & Impact

- **Transparency:** Reduces chances of land fraud and manipulation of ownership.
- **Efficiency:** Cuts down the processing time for land transactions and registration.
- **Accessibility:** Citizens can apply, track, and manage land records remotely.
- **Accountability:** Clear audit trail and logs improve governance.
- **Scalability:** Can be expanded to support mobile platforms, GIS integration, and blockchain-based verification.

## üß™ Future Scope

- **GIS & Mapping Integration** with open layers or Leaflet.js for land visualization.
- **Blockchain-backed ownership ledger** for tamper-proof transaction history.
- **E-signature and biometric verification** for added security.
- **Integration with Government Portals** like Nagarik App and Nagarik e-Sewa.
- **Multilingual Support** for wider reach across Nepalese communities.
